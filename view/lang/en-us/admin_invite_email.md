Dear %5$s,

  the administrator of %4$s has set up an account for you.

  The login details are as follows:

  Site Location:	%1$s
  Login Name:		%2$s
  Password:		%3$s

  You may change your password from your account "Settings" page after logging
  in.

  Please take a few moments to review the other account settings on that page.

  You may also wish to add some basic information to your default profile
  (on the "Profiles" page) so that other people can easily find you.

  We recommend setting your full name, adding a profile photo,
  adding some profile "keywords" (very useful in making new friends) - and
  perhaps what country you live in; if you do not wish to be more specific
  than that.

  We fully respect your right to privacy, and none of these items are necessary.
  If you are new and do not know anybody here, they may help
  you to make some new and interesting friends.

  If you ever want to delete your account, you can do so at %1$s/removeme

  Thank you and welcome to %4$s.
